Here, we observe several iterations of testing the reinforcement learning technique, UCB1. In the first image, "test_home," we see the initial state where the best matches were determined solely using FAISS. The following three images illustrate the testing process for the reinforcement learning component. During these tests, I selected the second most relevant result and spent approximately 5 minutes reviewing it each time. Consequently, the UCB1 score increased from 0 to 0.5, then from 0.5 to 0.67, and finally from 0.67 to 0.75, making it the most relevant document at that point due to the combined FAISS and UCB1 scores. In the final image, I clicked on the same document but only spent 10 seconds on it, which caused the UCB1 score to decrease to 0.6, thereby making it the second most relevant result once again.
